Terminal asks answers phone with a phrase. Then the program captures the response.

If the response is empty (user just hit enter), reply back with , "Hello"

if the response has any lowercase letters, reply back with, "I am having a hard time hearing you"

if the response has all caps, reply back with, "No this is not a grocery store"

if the response is "GOODBYE", increment a "goodbye" counter by one (start from zero). If the counter is equal to one,
    reply back with , "Is there anything I can help you with".

else if counter is 2, reply back and close the program.
    
Create a loop with the above program, so that it keeps requesting input from user.
